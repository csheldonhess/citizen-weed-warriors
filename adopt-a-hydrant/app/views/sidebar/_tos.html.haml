          Description of Weed Warrior
        %p
          Weed Warrior is an initiative of APF to encourage Anchorage residents to claim patches of invasive plants, for the purposes of removing them. The WW website allows users to &quot;adopt&quot; a patch of invasive plants, or state that you intend to help pull out invasive plants from that area.
        %p
          Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance WW are covered by this Agreement.
      %li
        %h3
          Obligations
        %p
          If you choose to adopt a patch using the WW website, you are under no obligation and have no responsibility to actually shovel out that patch or any patch.
      %li
        %h3
          Termination of Obligations
        %p
          If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, offensive, not current, or incomplete, or APF has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, offensive, not current, or incomplete, APF has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the WW services (or any portion thereof).
        %p
          Accounts that consistently adopt patchs without weeding them may also be terminated.
        %p
          Additionally, you agree that APF may, without prior notice, immediately terminate, limit your access to, or suspend your WW service. Cause for such termination, limitation of access, or suspension shall include but not be limited to:
